# ResultReplicationProject

Our analysis and code is shown under the notebooks folder. They consists of data regarding VPN and its variables in order to perform EDA. It shows graphs regarding different variables and visual representations. 

The code consists of importing pandas, matplotlib as well as using the datasets to display the graphs of the bytes being sent between the source computer and the destination. To run this code, all that is needed is to run the jupyter notebooks that will display the graphs.
